# OSRS-Goblin-Killing-Bot
Kills goblins between Lumbridge and Al-Kharid and picks up stackable loot. 
The bot will bank its items once it runs out of food and has 30 coins for tolls and food.
If there are no Kebabs in your bank, the bot will purchase up to 10 Kebabs before returning to kill goblins.

If you already have kebabs, shrimps, or bread in your bank then the bot will use those instead of buying kebabs.

As a safety mechanism the bot will not initiate combat unless it has at least one kebab or at least 10hp.

Start the script anywhere between the Al-Kharid bank and the goblins in front of the Al-Kharid toll-gate.

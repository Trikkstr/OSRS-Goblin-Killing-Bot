# OSRS-Goblin-Killing-Bot
Kills goblins and picks up loot. 
Designed for use on the goblins between Lumbridge and Al-Kharid.

As a safety mechanism the bot will not attack if there is no food in its inventory but the bot will continue to loot items.

Have one or more of these in your inventory before you start: Shrimps, Bread, Kebab

Just start the script next to the goblins once you are ready.
